## Website

A web-version of Awesome-Privacy is available at: **[awesome-privacy.xyz](https://awesome-privacy.xyz)**

The source for the website is managed in the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy/tree/gh-pages) branch.

The content is in markdown format, and pulled from the main branch using [this workflow](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-docs-branch.yml) running on GitHub actions. The site is built with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org), and deployed automatically onto [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

A mirror is also deployed to GH Pages, at: [lissy93.github.io/awesome-privacy](https://lissy93.github.io/awesome-privacy/)
